# Learning Nuggets

This app introduces the **Learning Center**, a dynamic content hub for educational nuggets organized by category. It blends structured Wagtail page models, global snippet management, and dynamic frontend behavior ‚Äî offering a modular, scalable way to build learning content.

---

## Features

- **Learning Center Landing Page**  
  A singleton page under the homepage that acts as the entry point to the Learning Center. It renders a category-based index and loads nugget content dynamically.

- **Category-Based Nuggets**  
  Nuggets are organized into categories (managed as **Wagtail snippets**) and rendered via custom URLs like:  
  ```
  /learning-center/<category>/<nugget>/
  ```

- **AJAX-Powered Navigation**  
  Nuggets load in the sidebar via AJAX for smooth transitions, while still supporting full server-side rendering (SSR) as a fallback.

- **Video Block Support**  
  Repurposed a `VideoBlock` from the Liquid site and added it to the CMS. It can be embedded within any nugget to enhance interactivity.

- **Role-Based Access**  
  Categories are tied to custom permissions (e.g., Moderator, Initiator, Participant) to control access per user role.

- **Modular Asset Structure**  
  Introduced an `assets/` folder at the app level to hold JS/CSS for better modularity and maintainability.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create the ‚ÄúLearning Nuggets‚Äù Singleton Page

- In Wagtail admin, go to the **Homepage**
- Add a new child page using the appropriate `LearningCenterPage` model
- **Name it exactly**: `Learning Center`  
  (this is critical for URL resolution to work)

This page will become the parent for all individual nuggets.

> üí° **Future enhancement:**  
> Improve routing so it no longer depends on the page title being `"Learning Center"`. Instead, we could fetch the first instance of the `LearningCenterPage` dynamically or use a site setting to define it explicitly. This would improve flexibility and avoid title-coupling.

### 2. Add Nuggets

- Under the ‚ÄúLearning Center‚Äù page, create new `LearningNuggetPage` entries
- Each nugget is tied to a **Category snippet**
- The category‚Äôs slug is used to build the final URL

---

### 3. Manage Categories via Snippets

- Go to **Snippets > Learning Categories**
- Add/edit categories globally
- Assign them to nuggets through the dropdown field in each nugget page

Each category has:
- A slug (used in URLs)
- A title
- A description
- A role-based permission (used to limit access)

## Preview Limitations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Wagtail‚Äôs preview functionality is currently unsupported for nuggets.**

Due to the use of custom routing (e.g., via a `CategoryView`), Wagtail‚Äôs default preview URLs don‚Äôt work. It attempts to load draft content through the live view, which fails if the associated category isn‚Äôt published or the object isn't resolved.

### Possible fix (future):

- Implement a custom `serve_preview()` method on the `LearningNuggetPage` model
- This would bypass the URL resolver and render the preview using a custom template
