# ROOTS
**ROOTS** is a fork of *adhocracy.plus*, adapted and extended to support the ROOTS project. This repository will serve as the foundation for developing new features that empower civil society organizations in their participatory digital transformation. The project is a collaboration between *Institut f√ºr Angewandte Informatik (InfAI)*, *Kindervereinigung Leipzig e.V. (KVL)*, and *Liquid Democracy*.

[adhocracy.plus](https://adhocracy.plus/) is a free Open-Source participation platform maintained and primarily developed by Liquid Democracy e.V.. It is based on [adhocracy 4](https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy4) and [Django](https://github.com/django/django). The project's [technical documentation](https://liqd.github.io/adhocracy-plus/) currently is in progress. You are welcome to provide feedback by creating a GitHub issue.

## Getting started

adhocracy+ is designed to make online participation easy and accessible to everyone. It can be used on our SaaS-platform or installed on your own servers. How to get started on our platform is explained [here](https://adhocracy.plus/info/start/).

## Installation for development

### Requirements

 * nodejs (+ npm) 
 * python 3.x (+ venv + pip)
 * libpq (only if postgres should be used)
 * sqlite3 [with JSON1 enabled](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/JSON1Extension)
 * redis (in production, not needed for development)
 * pillow-heif (required for macOS M1 Monterey and newer versions)

### Installation

    git clone git@github.com:liqd/roots.git
    cd roots
    make install 
    make fixtures

### Start virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Check if tests work
```
make test
```
### Start a local server
```
make watch
```
Go to http://localhost:8004/ and login with admin@liqd.net | password

## Installation on a production system

You like adhocracy+ and want to run your own version? An installation guide for production systems can be found [here](./docs/installation_prod.md).

## Contributing or maintaining your own fork

If you found an issue, want to contribute, or would like to add your own features to your own version of adhocracy+, check out our [contributing](./docs/contributing.md) document.

## Security

We take security seriously. If you find any security issues, please feel free to email us at info [at] liqd [dot] net.


## Advanced settings 

### Use postgresql database for testing

run the following command once:
```
make postgres-create
```
to start the test server with postgresql, run:
```
export DATABASE=postgresql
make postgres-start
make watch
```

### Use Celery for task queues

For a celery worker to pick up tasks you need to make sure that:
- the redis server is running. Check it by running
```
redis-cli ping 
```
it should return: PONG

- the celery config parameter "always eager" is disabled (add `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = False` to your `local.py`)
Celery's always_eager is disabled to ensure tests run the celery tasks inline instead of scheduling them via the Redis broker.
local.py should be under adhocracy_plus/config/settings, create one if it doesn't exist. This file saves settings for local development.

To start a celery worker node in the foreground, call:
```
make celery-worker-start
```

To inspect all registered tasks, list the running worker nodes, call:
```
make celery-worker-status
```

To send a dummy task to the queue and report the result, call:
```
make celery-worker-dummy-task
```
